## Project overview

Studently unifies course management, assignment tracking, GPA calculation, and AI-assisted study tools (summaries and question generation). It was implemented as a React + TypeScript frontend (React Router v7) and an AWS Amplify backend relying on Lambda functions (business logic) and API Gateway for endpoint exposure. Amazon Bedrock is used for AI summarization and Q&A, S3 is used for storing course resources, DynamoDB for storing metadata, and CloudWatch for monitoring logs.

## Key Features

- User authentication (Amazon Cognito via Amplify)
- Semester / Course management and GPA tracking
- Assignments CRUD and course progress tracking
- Document / notes upload to Amazon S3 (signed uploads handled by backend)
- AI Summarization (calls to Amazon Bedrock from Lambda)
- AI Q&A / Chatbot (Lambda integration) ‚Äî implemented and tested as a Lambda chatbot function
- Backend logic implemented as AWS Lambda functions invoked through API Gateway (fronted by Amplify configuration)

Note about Amazon Q: The project was directed to include Amazon Q as part of the hackathon brief, but Amazon Q access (QBusiness) requires organizational access.


## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway


### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
